# Resume Optimiser

**Resume Optimiser** is an AI-powered application designed to help job seekers improve how their resumes communicate value — not just how they look.

The project focuses on a simple idea:  
👉 *Most resumes don’t fail because of lack of skills, but because they fail to tell the right story.*

This tool uses AI and NLP techniques to analyze resume content and provide actionable suggestions to improve clarity, structure, and impact.

## 🚀 Why This Project Exists

In today’s hiring landscape:
- Recruiters spend only a few seconds scanning resumes
- Strong candidates often get rejected due to poor wording or structure
- Resume screening is increasingly automated and AI-assisted

While learning **AI/ML, GenAI, and sales & persuasion**, I realized that hiring is not just a technical process — it’s a **communication problem**.

This project is an attempt to combine:
- AI & NLP  
- Real hiring pain points  
- Storytelling and positioning

- Analyze resume content using AI
- Identify weak, vague, or repetitive sections
